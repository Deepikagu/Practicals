<i>Dear brothers and sisters</i>, do remember one thing. <u>Malala Day</u> is not my day. <font color=blue>Today is the day of every  woman, every boy and every girl who have raised their voice for their rights.</font>  </br>
</p>There are hundreds of Human rights activists and social workers who are not only speaking for their rights, but who are struggling to achieve their goals of peace, education and equality. Thousands of people have been killed by the terrorists and millions have been injured. </p>
<hr size=12>
<font size=15>I am just one of them. So here I stand.... one girl among many. I speak â€• not for myself, but so those without voice can be heard.</font></br>
<p> Those who have fought for their rights: Their right to live in peace. Their right to be treated with dignity. Their right to equality of opportunity. Their right to be educated. Dear Friends, on the<blink> 9th of October 2012</blink>, [they] shot me on the left side of my forehead. They shot my friends too.</p>
